    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 can italian crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
            Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder, 
            oregano, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. 
            Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
            until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Keep warm until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). 
            Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 
            1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in the first bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl. 
            Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 
            and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the third bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. 
            Dredge a chicken breast in flour mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread crumb 
            mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread remaining chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over medium-high heat until oil is hot but not smoking. 
            Add breaded chicken in batches; cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the 
            prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over chicken.
